# simple-Crypting-For-PB
This Project will create .NET dll to implement crypto object en|decrypter for Powerbuilder

## Purpose
- Implement simple implementation dll for Powerbuilder Programming
- Also Supplement Assembly for SQL Server will used in SP for Powerbuilder Clients

## Cause of Not Implemented some cryptographic options In Powerbuilder
For Example
- AES Encryption with GCM mode
  - This is important to secure using Symmetric Encrypting Function in morden
- Diffie Hellman Key Exchange or else equivalent
  - for 2nd layer securing to transport sensitive data

## Informations
