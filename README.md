# simple-.NET-Crypting-For-PB
This Project will create .NET dll to implement crypto object en|decrypter for Powerbuilder

## Purpose
- Implement simple implementation dll for Powerbuilder Programming
- Also Supplement Assembly for SQL Server will used in SP for Powerbuilder Clients

## Cause of Not Implemented some cryptographic options In Powerbuilder
For Example
- AES Encryption with GCM mode
  - This is important to secure using Symmetric Encrypting Function in morden
  - (Not supported in .NET Framework 4.8.1)
    - Fallback to AES-256-CBC (this will ensure cross compatibility between PB and SQL Server)
- Diffie Hellman Key Exchange or else equivalent
  - for 2nd layer securing to transport sensitive data 
  - (In TLS already used, but bi-layered encrypt for more secure handling)
- Bcrypt Password encoding or and so on to PW encryption
  - this is the matter of one-way password encryption well
  - just using 1 pass of hash function, eg. SHA-512 isn't secure enough

## Informations
- Target Frameworks
  - .NET Framework 4.8.1
    - This is ensure Cross compatibility between PB versions
    - Also for SQL Server Assembly
  - .NET 8
    - This is for Powerbuilder 2022 R3 Latest or 2025
- Implemented Methods
  - AES-256-CBC
    - This is for basic symmetric encryption
  - Bcrypt Password Hashing
    - This is for secure password hashing
